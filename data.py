sending = "Sunday, June 15 I called out to Jehovah, and he answered me.​—Jonah 2:2. In the belly of the fish, Jonah was confident that Jehovah would listen to his humble and repentant prayer and that Jehovah would help him. Later, Jonah was returned to dry land, and he was ready to accept and fulfill his next assignment. (Jonah 2:10–3:4) During a trial, do you ever feel too anxious to express yourself clearly in prayer? Or do you feel too weak to study? Remember that Jehovah understands your situation perfectly. So even when you offer a simple prayer, you can be sure that he will give you exactly what you need. (Eph. 3:20) If your physical or emotional pain makes it difficult for you to read and study, you might try listening to audio recordings of the Bible or of Bible-based publications. You may also find it helpful to listen to one of our songs or to watch a video on jw.org. By praying to Jehovah and by looking for the answer in the spiritual provisions that he makes available, you invite him to make you strong."
